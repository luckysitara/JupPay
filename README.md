# **JupPay: A Decentralized Payment Gateway on Solana**  

## **Problem Statement**  
Merchants and users in the Solana ecosystem struggle with accepting and making payments due to high fees, slow transaction speeds on other chains, and fragmented tools. Many existing payment solutions lack:  

- **Seamless token swaps**: Users often need to manually swap tokens before making payments.  
- **Easy onboarding**: Many solutions require crypto knowledge and complex setup.  
- **Low-cost and instant transactions**: Some existing solutions charge high fees or rely on off-chain services.  
- **User-friendly payment methods**: There is no widely adopted **link-based** payment method for instant payments without wallet setup.
